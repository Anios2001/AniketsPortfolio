# AniketsPortfolio
Git Repo for portfolio
## Problem Statement 
I was facing a problem of showing my work to the recruiters, so i decided to create a dynamic portfolio on which you can run the projects directly. So, i created a portfolio for the same using HTML,CSS and JavaScript alongwith a backend to power the application that run on the websites.
Way to run the project 
use the import_data folder to initiate the database in mysql environment 
mysql root should contain projects database
cd import_data
mysql -u root -p projects < data.sql 
exit 
npm install
node app.js
